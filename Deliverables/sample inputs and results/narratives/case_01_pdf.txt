A 72 year old male patient with a medical history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and stage 1 chronic kidney disease, and taking metformin, lisinopril, and atorvastatin, was prescribed levofloxacin 500mg daily for a suspected urinary tract infection. On day 4 of levofloxacin therapy, he developed acute confusion, muscle weakness, and tremors. Examination revealed mild hypotension and QT interval prolongation on ECG. Levofloxacin was promptly discontinued, and the symptoms resolved within 3 days. The ECG normalized within 5 days. The case was reported to the hospital pharmacovigilance team. The suspected adverse reaction was CNS symptoms (confusion, tremors) and cardiac effects (QT prolongation) associated with levofloxacin use. The case was reported by Dr. Alicia Green, Internal Medicine Specialist.
